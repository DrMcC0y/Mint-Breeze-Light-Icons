### ðŸ–¼ Description

**Mint-Breeze-Light-Icons** is a modern, unified icon set designed to complement the [Mint-Breeze-Light GTK theme](https://www.pling.com/p/2302153/).
It aims to deliver a clean and visually consistent desktop experience for Linux Mint Cinnamon users â€” but it works well with other GTK-based desktops too.

The set includes redesigned system icons, updated application icons, and custom folder styles to enhance clarity and harmony across the system.

It is partially based on open source icon themes licensed under the GPL, such as:

* **Breeze** â€“ many icons were used as-is or modified
* **Numix-Circle** â€“ used occasionally for some application icons
* **Papirus** â€“ used in very small parts (e.g., one or two icons)
* **Hicolor** â€“ one or two icons included from this fallback theme

**Mint-Breeze-Light** was created as a bright counterpart to the **[Mint Relaxed](https://www.pling.com/p/2302153/)** theme (which is also a Breeze derivative). I didnâ€™t just mix existing icon sets â€” I also:

* Redesigned many outdated icons to match the modern aesthetic
* Created many icons from scratch
* Carefully curated and unified the overall look to fit the Cinnamon environment
